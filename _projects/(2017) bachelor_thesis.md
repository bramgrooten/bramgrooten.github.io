# Bipartite graph matching optimization

In the final research project of my bachelor at the Eindhoven University of Technology I applied graph theory to a real-life challenge. I used linear optimization algorithms to solve the problem of assigning many elementary school pupils to a preferred high school. The solutions that we computed for the data of 2015 and 2016 gave a much better overal assignment, as you can read in the [1-page summary](/assets/pdfs/SummaryBachelorFinalProject.pdf).
