# Serpentine AI

In 2020 â€“ 2021, I was the chairman of Serpentine, which is a student team of the TU Eindhoven. We give students hands-on experience in AI programming, by participating in multiple competitions. Have a look at our [website](https://www.serpentine.ai/), or see the video below.

As a team-lead, I have participated in four AI programming contests, **winning prizes** in two of them. See _AI Snakes_ and _Angry Birds_ on the [publications page](https://www.serpentine.ai/publications).
