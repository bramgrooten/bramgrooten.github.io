# Hackathon

In November 2022, I participated in the [Junction Hackathon](https://www.hackjunction.com/) with a great team from [Serpentine AI](https://serpentine.ai/). We competed in the challenge “Year 2222” which required us to invent a plausible problem & solution that might come up 200 years in the future.

We designed and implemented our project called “Cosmic Quest”. It’s an algorithm that continually searches for the next best planet to expand our human colony towards. By simulating a small Milky Way galaxy, we could show a nice demo. Make sure to hit play, and zoom in on the planets around the stars.

See our [demo here](https://junction-2022-cosmic-quest.vercel.app/).
