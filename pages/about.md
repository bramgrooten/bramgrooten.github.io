# **About Me**

Hi I am Bram Grooten :wave:,<br>

I am a PhD student in Deep Learning at the TU Eindhoven, started in November 2021. Currently doing an internship at Sony AI in the [Gran Turismo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04357-7) team on generalization in deep reinforcement learning.

My research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning** and **Sparse Training** of neural networks. Iâ€™m in the [Data and Artificial Intelligence](https://dai.win.tue.nl/team/) cluster with supervisors [Decebal Mocanu](https://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/dcs/members/decebal_constantin_mocanu) and [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/mykola-pechenizkiy/).

In 2023, I visited the **University of Alberta** for 5 months as part of my PhD, joining the [Intelligent Robot Learning](https://irll.ca/team/) lab of Matthew Taylor.

In 2021, I finished two masters at the TU Eindhoven called:

- Industrial and Applied Mathematics ([IAM](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-industrial-and-applied-mathematics/))
- Science Education and Communication ([SEC](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-science-education))

You can find both master theses on [my TU/e page](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/bram-j-grooten). The thesis for IAM was titled: _Deep Reinforcement Learning for the cooperative card game Hanabi_.
