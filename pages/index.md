I am a postdoc in the the [AMOR/e](https://amore-labs.github.io/website/) lab at the **TU Eindhoven**, working with [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/) on vision-language-action models for robotics. In 2026, I am finishing my PhD on generalization in deep reinforcement learning, supervised by [Decebal Mocanu](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/people/decebal-constantin-mocanu/) and [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/mykola-pechenizkiy/). Research interests include robotics, VLAs, RL, generalization, sparse neural networks.

During my PhD, I did an internship at **Sony AI** in the [Gran Turismo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04357-7) team.
We published a paper on large-scale generalization, accepted as an oral at AAAI 2026. Read the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09737)
and see the presentation below.

In 2023, I visited the **University of Alberta** for 5 months as part of my PhD, joining the 
[Intelligent Robot Learning](https://irll.ca/team/) lab of Matthew Taylor.
See the talk I gave in the AI Seminar Series by [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/) below.

In 2021, I finished two masters at the TU Eindhoven called:

- Industrial and Applied Mathematics ([IAM](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-industrial-and-applied-mathematics/))
- Science Education and Communication ([SEC](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/graduate-school/master-science-education))

You can find both master theses on [my TU/e page](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/bram-j-grooten). The thesis for IAM was titled: _Deep Reinforcement Learning for the cooperative card game Hanabi_.

For my bachelor of Applied Mathematics, I started my studies at Wentworth Institute of Technology, in Boston, USA. My [bachelor’s thesis](/projects/bachelor-thesis) used graph theory and optimization for a matching assignment problem.
